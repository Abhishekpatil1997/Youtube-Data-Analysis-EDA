#  Project Title: Youtube Data Analysis EDA
This project involved creating an end-to-end data analysis pipeline to explore insights from YouTube data.
# **For more details on the analysis, please refer to the attached [PDF report](./Youtube_EDA_Project_Report.pdf).**

The key steps involved were:

- Loading a large CSV dataset containing information on YouTube videos, channels, comments etc.

- Cleaning the data by handling missing values, formatting issues etc. 

- Performing exploratory data analysis to uncover insights about YouTube viewership, engagement, popular channels etc. 

- Applying text analysis techniques like sentiment analysis using textblob to classify video comments as positive, negative or neutral

- Visualizing text data as word clouds using the wordcloud library to identify frequent words

- Generating charts and plots to understand relationships between video attributes like views, likes, dislikes etc.

- Summarizing findings in a presentation/report format

This project demonstrates skills in:

- Python programming - pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, textblob, wordcloud etc.

- Statistical analysis and data visualization 

- Text analysis 

- Exploratory data analysis

- Insight generation from large datasets

The full analysis can be found in the Jupyter notebook. Future work could involve developing a machine learning model based on the trends found.
